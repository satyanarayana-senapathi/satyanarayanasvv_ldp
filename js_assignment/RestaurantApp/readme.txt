Problem Statement:
"Hyderabad's top most restaurant wants ZeMoSo Labs to design a single page web app for dealing with their billing system, the app should be simple enough for waiters to take order on the go, and should be usable on mobiles too, 
the app should consist of menu and tables, order beings with start of a new session and when session ended, the app should generate bill for that particular table, the menu should be searchable and sort-able based on items,
 type of items, a drag-and-drop model might help the waiters dealing the busy hall."
Please find following images for references.
1) Landing Page of the Application.

2) The filter of menu contents, a waiter can search by menu item ( by item name ex: biriyani), or by course type ( entree, main course, desserts, appetizers, beverages etc.)

3) A waiter can filter tables by table names as shown in below image.

A waiter should be able to drag the menu item onto a table card and drop the card, this action should add that item to that table's order and the related number of items and total cost of that table should be updated.
4) A waiter can click on any of the table items to get a detailed view of that table's orders on a model/pop -up.

As shown in above image, a table's order items can be increased say a person of table-1 wants to reorder an item the waiter can just update the number of servings or can delete the item if the customer canceled the order.
